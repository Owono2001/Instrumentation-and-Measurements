For the Instrumentation and Measurements assignment, I conducted experiments focused on potentiometers, Wheatstone bridges, and operational amplifiers. The objective of these experiments was to explore and understand how these components operate in various circuit configurations.

Potentiometer Experiment: This experiment demonstrated the ability of a potentiometer to vary resistance. I constructed a potentiometric circuit to analyze its linearity, repeatability, and hysteresis. Measurements were taken for different voltage levels and compared under loaded and unloaded conditions. The results showed how voltage varied as the potentiometer was adjusted, providing insights into its practical applications in controlling electrical circuits.

Wheatstone Bridge Experiment: I constructed a Wheatstone bridge circuit to demonstrate both balanced and unbalanced conditions. By varying the resistance in one arm of the bridge, I calculated the unknown resistance and determined the balanced condition where no current flows through the galvanometer. This experiment showcased the precise measurement capabilities of the Wheatstone bridge for resistance values.

Operational Amplifier Experiment: I simulated operational amplifier circuits to analyze their inverting and non-inverting configurations. The experiments involved measuring input and output voltages, calculating gain, and observing waveform behaviors using an oscilloscope. The results demonstrated the practical limitations of operational amplifiers and how the configurations affect the gain and output signal.

These experiments provided valuable hands-on experience in measuring and analyzing electrical components, reinforcing the principles of instrumentation and measurements.
